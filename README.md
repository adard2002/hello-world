# Hello, My name is Adara and welcome to my website!

## Introduction
My name is **Adara Townsend**. I have played video games for pretty much my whole life. First console I have ever touched was the Playstation 2. When I got my own laptop which was a Windows 8 Gateway 15.6" Intel Pentium My first game I got was Minecraft. Which is where I met a couple of my online friends who code their own plugins for their servers on Minecraft and I want to be able to possibly help them out with plugins in the future.
