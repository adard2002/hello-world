        <h2>Process of designing a web page</h2>
    <p>First, you are going to want to set up a Site Map and a wireframe for your web page. You will probably want to use pencil and paper because you will want to show your customer your making the web pages for will be satisfied with your work. There may be some trial and error getting it what your customer's expectations may be. Down below are an example of each. </p>
    <li>What is a Site Map?</li>
        <p>It is a layout of what will all be seen in your navigation bar and what will all be inside each and every link that is in your navigation bar. It will help you organize and plan out what will be in those tabs. </p>

        <h2>Designing Navigation</h2>
        <p>You will want to decide on where you want your Navigation bar to be located; top, left, right, or footer. Once you have figured that part out, it's time to think of what it will look like and how it's going to be easy to understand where the user is at. You will want to make it look nice. Not all cluttered with several different links. Keep the names of the links short and simple such as "Home" and "About Us". Make it easy for the user to understand where they are located in the site, like when they go to the "About Us" page you should have an arrow or some kind of indication they are at that tab. An example can be seen below:</p>

    <p>In this example you can see they are located at the "Home" page and are looking at the "Bootstrap" tab. Which has a few choices of pages to go to. It's not clutered, it's easy to read and simple to follow.</p>
