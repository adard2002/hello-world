# Hello, My name is Adara and welcome to my website!

## Introduction
My name is **Adara Townsend**. I have played video games my whole life. First console I have ever touched was the Playstation 2. When I got my own laptop which was a Windows 8 Gateway 15.6" Intel Pentium My first game I got was Minecraft. Which is where I met my online friends and a couple of them got me into coding and they are why I am here trying to learn coding today.
