            <h2>About HTML</h2>
            <li>What is HTML?</li>
    <p>
    HTML is an acronym which stands for "Hypertext Markup Language"
            <li>What exactly is HTML code?</li>
    The HTML code has angled brackets which contain characters which are inside angled brackets. The angled brackets are called elements, and these elements have two parts to them. An opening and a closing, the closing element will have a forward slash. This tells the program that that is where the command ends. There are some open ended elements too, such as the \<img src\> element.
            <h2>Process of designing a web page</h2>

        <li>What is a Site Map?</li>
        <p>
        It is a layout of what will all be seen in your navigation bar and what will all be inside each and every link that is in your navigation bar. It will help you organize and plan out what will be in those tabs.

             <h2>What to look for in designing a navigation bar</h2>
    <p>
        - Decide where you want your Nav. Bar located; top, left, right, etc.
        - Make it look nice appealing to the eye, have your main tabs like "Home" and "About Us" and "Contact"
        - Once you have your main tabs you can then add your secondary tabs which will show when the user hovers over it or clicks a dropdown arrow.
        - The users will need some indication as to where they are in your site. Which can be accomplished by several choices; highlighting, arrow, color change, etc.  
    </p>

         </div>
    <p>
    In this example you can see they are located at the "Home" page and are looking at the "Bootstrap" tab. Which has a few choices of pages to go to. It's not clutered, it's easy to read and simple to follow.</p>
