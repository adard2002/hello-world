        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, since HTML was just the structure of a web page CSS is putting all of the details on the structure.
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        The thing to pay attention too trying to understand how CSS works is there is a box around all of the HTML elements. <br>
        CSS works by cooperating with the rules of HTML elements. These rules control how the content of specified elements will be shown throughout the site.
        The rules of CSS contains two parts. One being a <b>Selector</b> and the other being a <u>declaration</u>.
