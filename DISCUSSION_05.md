        <h1>Design web pages with CSS</h1>
        <li>What is CSS?</li>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, since HTML was just the structure of a web page CSS is putting all of the details on the structure.
        <li>How does it work?</li>
        The thing to pay attention too trying to understand how CSS works is there is a box around all of the HTML elements. <br>
        CSS works by cooperating with the rules of HTML elements. These rules control how the content of specified elements will be shown throughout the site.
        The rules of CSS contains two parts. One being a <b>Selector</b> and the other being a <u>declaration</u>. The example below tells you that everything between the &lt;p&gt; element is going to have the Arial font applied to it.<br>
                Example: <b>p</b>{ <br>
                    <u>font-family: Arial;</u>}<br>
        - <b>Selectors:</b> tell which element the rule applies to. In the example above this tells you that everything within the &lt;p&gt; will be changed.<br>
        - <u>Declaration:</u> tells which rule is going to be applied to the element. In the example above this tells you it wants to change everything to the Arial font.<br>
