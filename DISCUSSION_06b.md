    <h1>Computer Architecture and Logic</h1>
    <h2>What makes a computer a computer?</h2>
    <p>
    The ability to take input, store it, process it and then output the results.
    <bold>Input:</bold> Tells the computer what to do.<br>
    <bold>Store:</bold> Information is stored in the memory.<br>
    <bold>Process:</bold> They take the stored information and process what it's supposed to do.<br>
    <bold>Output:</bold> This gives you the results. Which could be really anything like the result of an equation on a calculator, or a video game you play.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Difference between hardware and software</h2>
    <p>
    - Hardware: Is the parts inside of your computer such as the circuits, chips, wires, speakers etc. <br>
    - Software: Is the computer programs or code running in the machine. Can be anything from apps to webpages and games. <br>
    <h3>How do they interact with eachother?</h3>
    It all starts with the CPU or Central Processing Unit. What this does is controls the parts of the computer. It needs to be able to do several different things so inside contains smaller and simpler parts that handle specific tasks. It knows which circuit to use and when to use them. Simple commands that are used in the CPU are all made up of binary code or ones and zeros.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Binary code?</h2>
    <p>
    Binary code is the most basic form of software which controls all the hardware of the computer. People don't use binary code anymore because it would take forever to do since it is made up of the ones and zeros you have likely seen before. So instead, we use more english based coding languages like Python, Ruby, or Blockly. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is an Operating System</h2>
    <p>
    The operating system is the master program that controls how software gets to use the hardware of a computer. It has special abilities that allows it to control other softwares on the computer. When you install a program it does this by loading them into your computer's memory. It allows the software to be run by the central processing unit and whether that program can have the access to the computers input and output devices. When you think your computer is running several programs at once it's actually your operating system that is switching between the programs sharing that CPU for a fraction of a second.
    </p>
    <h2>Why were computers so slow back then?</h2>
    <p>
    Computers were very slow when they were first being developed. It would take a long time to process even the simplest math equation. This was because the circuits that were used back then were the size of a fridge at times. Which makes it so there is more travel distance for the electric signals. Computers now are very fast because they are much smaller.
